Abstract: Initially, I wanted to create a Halloween slot-machine style quiz. There was an in-class reference to the Queen Supreme, and I instantly gravitated toward American Horror Story:Coven. Jessica Lange plays a particularly bad witch during said season. Nevertheless, I am fascinated with her as a person and as an actress.Unfortunately, as I was using the googles for quiz questions, I came upon a disturbing statistic: In 2019, one percent of high school girls expressed their interest in majoring in computer science at the college level. I know I mention Bill O'Reilly a lot in my READMEs, but with a Bill O'Reilly sense of enthusisam, I drank two Rockstars, and scrapped my original project. I had a background color which changed multiple times from purple to green. I had code. I had Screamin' Jay Hawkins. I had a marginally decent timer. I had headers. And yet like that maniacal Bill O'Reilly, I drank two Redbulls and did it live. 
In retrospect, I created a very pink female empowerment page wherein TSwizzle tries to rap. After I submitted, I naturally found the content is a bit scandalous. So I probably should NOT use that music video in the futures. Seriously, I like the aesthetics of ten seconds of that video. This is a bit like when I took a Hemingway survey class and didn't read the end of The Sun Also Rises. It's a story. I coded out about fifteen thousand different timers under HTML(I believe that it was supposed to be Jquery). I believe that because Bart told me today that it's probably JQuery. Bart knows things. I created a Wix account so that I could generate a but-ton which would link to my quiz(I know in the first week we did pre-work which required students to create their own website. I was too embarassed to ask for help. Instead, I made a quick Wix site and realized that Girls Who Code was not conceived in my giant Irish head. Originally, my quiz questions were made into buttons. They're all teacher jokes. Teachers are funny when we're exhausted(so all the time?) I then deleted them so that I could create a button to send said questions to a website. I then forgot how to make buttons, though I had previously made buttons. I was tired. I didn't get the timer in, and I procured a website so that I could deploy the quiz to said site. No timer. No link to quiz. I feel a bit like Brian in The Breakfast Club when he admits he couldn't make the lamp work. Non-existent Bender keeps telling me, "you're a genius for not making the lamp work". 
I spent forty-five hours on this assignment. That is not a fabrication in any capacity. I wanted girls to have a cool place to take quizzes. On a personal note, somebody just told me one day that I was bad at math, and I bought it. I'm not alone. We need more girls in math and science. More importantly, I need to be a conduit to girls gravitating toward math and science. I did the sticky footer. That's cool, right?
